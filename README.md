# FluBase
A personal reference project for common dialogs and pages.
This largely will incorporate styles for the Settings and About-dialogs to maintain consistency between my multiple apps.

My goal for these custom dialogs/pages is to bring a more modern look to apps, incorporating some influences of Fluent Design.

I've decided to make this a seperate project to keep these items easier maintained between my other projects (and to make it easier to understand for other people that would like to incorporate them :) ).
